# Evolution_AI
Just run the file run.py and read the command prompt. A list of keys allows you to control the simulation.

The project purpous is to create red creatures who chase green creatures and eat them. Their brain uses a genetic algorithm that I implemented from scratch.
This project was a lot of fun, but is not very usefull. It's just a really nive desktop background now...
